| Lightmap Resolution                   | Make sure most actors look green-ish when Lightmap Density viewmode is enabled, as green area indicates ideal texel density.          | High Lighmap resolution will increase light baking time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                      |

| Light Movability                      | Plan out the usage of dynamic lights based on your needs. Avoid over using dynamic lights.                                            | Static Lights are cheaper than Movable ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Only 4 or fewer overlapping Stationary lights can cast static shadows, the additional ones will be treated as dynamic lights and impact performance. |
| Attenuation Radius                    | Should be set to reasonable value.

| Animated Objects                      | Using Sequences for animated objects is recomanded.                                                                                   | Sequences are easier to change on set and could be triggered by blueprints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Consider using approaches like Panner and/or World Position Offset in materials for simple looping animation.                                        |
| FPS                                   | 30FPS                                                                                                                                 | The framerate of animation sequences should match shooting framerate. 30FPS is frequently used in Moonshine XR Studio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Includes Sequencer animations, image sequences, fbx or abc animations.                                                                               |
| ABC                                   | Not recommanded for animated objects.                                                                                                 | Too expensive in terms of performance costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Consider using Flipbooks for distant animted objects.                                                                                                |
